1. Define your data (what you store)Quiz table: Question, Option A/B/C/D, Correct Option, Skill Category (Design, Writing, Social Media, Pricing, Customer Care), Points.Results table: User name or nickname only (no email), Date, Category, Score, Skill Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced).Projects table: Project title, Skill used, Deadline, Status (To‑do/Done), Earnings amount.Summary fields: Total projects done, total earnings, savings goal, progress.These tables match how quiz builders organize questions and results for scoring. ��2. Plan your screensHome screenShows buttons: “Take Quiz,” “My Skills,” “My Projects,” “Earnings.”Display: today’s quiz count and total earnings from the summary fields.Take Quiz screenList of skill categories; tapping one starts a quiz filtered by that category, similar to basic quiz‑app tutorials. ��After finishing, save score in Results and show a message like “You are Intermediate in Social Media Writing.”My Skills screenFor each category, compute average score and convert to level using simple rules (e.g., 0–40% Beginner, 41–80% Intermediate, 81–100% Advanced).Show as colored badges or progress bars—no AI, just percentage formulas.My Projects screenSimple list where user adds a project: title, skill, deadline.When status is changed to “Done,” pop up a small form asking “How much did you earn?” and write that value to the Projects table.Earnings screenSum all earnings and count finished projects (most app builders have built‑in “sum” and “count” functions). ��Optional: progress bar toward a savings goal (total ÷ goal × 100).3. Building it in a no‑code toolChoose an app builder with quiz templates and drag‑and‑drop design, such as Glide or a quiz‑app template, so you avoid heavy coding. ���Steps are usually:Create a new app from a “Quiz” or “Custom Quiz Manager” template. ��Replace the sample quiz questions with your freelance‑skills questions.Add new tables for Projects and Earnings, then add list and form components for them.Add simple computed columns for totals and levels (percentage, sum, count).4. Keeping it within the mini‑app rulesOnly use nickname or “User ID” instead of full names or emails so you don’t store private data.Limit questions per category (for example, 10–20) so it stays small and fast.Avoid any external AI or large databases; everything is just quizzes, lists, and simple math, which matches the allowed “quizzes, calculators, productivity tools, and fun generators.

A stylized logo featuring a minimalist icon of a laptop with a gear and a graph overlay, symbolizing freelance work and skill growth. The background is a soft gradient from light blue to white, with the icon centered and a subtle shadow. The logo should convey professionalism and progress, suitable for a freelance skills tracker app.
